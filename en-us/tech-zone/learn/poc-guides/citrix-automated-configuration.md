## Overview

The Citrix-developed [Automated Configuration tool](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-cloud/betas-and-tech-previews/automated-configuration-technology-preview.html) facilitates migrating and exporting configurations to the **Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktop Service** (CVADs). This Proof of Concept guide illustrates the step by step instructions on how to leverage this tool.

Administrators can easily test and explore the **Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktop Service** (CVADs) features and advantages, while simultaneously running existing On-Premises environments, as well as facilitate moves between cloud regions, back up existing configurations, and other supported use cases. The [Automated Configuration download link](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-cloud/betas-and-tech-previews/automated-configuration-technology-preview.html) also contains **additional information** and **detailed documentation** on said **use cases** and **customizations**.

### What is the Automated Configuration tool for Virtual Apps and Desktops?

This tool is designed to help automate the migration of **Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktop** configuration (such as policies, applications, machine catalogs, and others) from one or more On-Premises site(s) to the **Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktop service** (CVADs) hosted on Citrix Cloud. It can also be used to migrate information between **different Cloud regions** or **tenants**.

The migration can be performed in stages by executing the tool multiple times, allowing administrators to easily achieve the desired configuration state.

### Why use this tool?

IT Administrators, particularly those dealing with large environments, often find migrations to be a very tedious process. They frequently end up writing their own tools to accomplish this task successfully since it tends to be specific to their use cases.

Citrix wants to help ease this process by providing a tool that addresses use cases by means of automation. Administrators can now easily test their current configurations in Citrix Cloud and take advantage of the benefits offered by CVADs (such as a reduced administrative overload when managing the control plane) while still keeping their current environments intact.

### How is this tool implemented?

Citrix has leveraged industry standard configuration as code to provide a mechanism to help automate migration processes. Essentially, with this tool, we discover and export one or more on-premises sites as **a collection of configuration files** (which administrators can optionally edit) and then import these edited files into CVADs.

Note that this code is not limited to migrations: it is the future for creating configuration for Citrix sites, and as such, it is applicable for use cases such as Disaster recovery, Development/Testing/Staging to Production site synchronization, Geographic (GEO) moves, creating a combination of objects automatically (parallel to Microsoft Azure ARM templates / AWS Cloud formation), and several other scenarios.

## Pre-requisites

### On-Premises environment

*  CVAD On-Premises environment with **at least one registered VDA**.
*  CVAD On-Premises environment running on one of the following versions: Any **Long Term Service Release (LTSR)** versions with their latest CU (7.6, 7.15, 1912); Or one of the corresponding latest two **Current Releases (CR)** versions (for example: 2003, 2006).
*  The domain-joined machine where the [Automated Configuration tool](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-cloud/betas-and-tech-previews/automated-configuration-technology-preview.html) will be installed must be running .NET 4.7.2 version or higher.
*  A machine with the C**itrix PowerShell SDK**, which is automatically installed on the DDC. **Note:** if running on a different machine, it needs to be domain-joined and Studio must have the correct PowerShell snap-ins installed. This installer can be found on your corresponding version’s **Product ISO installation media**, which can be obtained from the [Citrix Downloads > Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops/) website.
*  Download the [Automated Configuration tool MSI](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-cloud/betas-and-tech-previews/automated-configuration-technology-preview.html).

### Cloud-related components

*  Valid **CVADs** or **Workspace Premium Plus** licenses.
*  Administrator must be able to log into the [Cloud Portal](https://citrix.cloud.com) and obtain: The **resource location name**, **customer ID**, **client Secret** (**app ID** and **Secret Key**)
*  The existing cloud Resource Location has at least **one Cloud Connector**, which is marked as green (Healthy) and is part of the same domain as the On-Premises setup. **Note:** Citrix recommends having **two or more Cloud Connectors** (for redundancy and High Availability). For information on how to set up your Cloud Connectors, please refer to [this guide]([https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/tech-zone/learn/poc-guides/cvads.html).

### Complete Pre-requisites for Exporting from on-premises site

These steps must be run in your DDC or the domain-joined machine where you wish to install the **Automated Configuration** tool.

1.  Download the latest [Automated Configuration tool MSI](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-cloud/betas-and-tech-previews/automated-configuration-technology-preview.html) to your **On-Premises DDC** or a domain-joined machine. **Note:** See the [Pre-requisites section](#pre-requisites) for more details on how to run it from a different machine.

2.  Run the **MSI** on your **On-Premises DDC**, by right clicking on the **AutoConfig_PowerShell_x64.msi** installer and clicking on **Install**.
[![On Prem Pre-Requisites](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_on-prem-pre-requisites-001.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_on-prem-pre-requisites-001.png)

3.  Read the **License Agreement** and check the box if you accept the terms. Then click on **Install**:
[![On Prem Pre-Requisites](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_on-prem-pre-requisites-002.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_on-prem-pre-requisites-002.png)

4.  After the **MSI** runs, a window indicating successful completion pops up. Click on **Finish** to close the **MSI setup** window.

[![On Prem Pre-Requisites](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_on-prem-pre-requisites-003.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_on-prem-pre-requisites-003.png)

*  **Note:** Upon successful execution, the **MSI** will create the corresponding folder structure, located in ```C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Citrix\AutoConfig```, as well as a desktop icon called **Auto Config**, which launches a PowerShell command prompt. This is the tool we will use on subsequent steps.

## Export your On-Premises site configuration

Using an ```export``` PowerShell command, you can export your existing On-Premises configuration and obtain the necessary *.yml* files, which will then be used to import your desired configuration into Citrix Cloud.

1.  After running the **MSI** installer on the previous step, you will get an **Auto Config** shortcut automatically created on the Desktop. Right click this shortcut and click on **Run as Administrator**:
[![Exporting Config](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_export-config-001.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_export-config-001.png)

2.  The **Auto Config** PowerShell tool will open and the current directory will point to the tool’s default path (```C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Citrix\AutoConfig```). **Note:** This is also where the *.yml* files will be created.
[![Exporting Config](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_export-config-002.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_export-config-002.png)

3.  On the **Auto Config** Command Prompt, run the ```Export-CvadAcToFile -all $true``` command. This command will export policies, manually provisioned catalogs and delivery groups, applications, application folders, icons, zone mappings, tags and other items in the infrastructure. **Note:** For **MCS** and **PVS** machine catalogs and delivery groups, refer to the steps on [Requisites for Importing Site Configuration using different Provisioning Methods section](#requisites-for-importing-site-configuration-using-different-provisioning-methods) in this guide.
[![Exporting Config](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_export-config-002-1.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_export-config-002-1.png)

4.  Once the tool finishes running, the **Overall status** shows as **True** and the export process is completed. You will see several output lines like the ones on the illustration below. **Note:** If there are any  errors, diagnostic files are created in the action-specific subfolders ```(Export, Import, Merge, Restore, Sync, Backup, Compare)```, which can be found under ```%HOMEPATH%\Documents\Citrix\AutoConfig```. Please refer to the [Troubleshooting Tips section](#troubleshooting-tips) shall you encounter any errors.

*  After this, please follow the steps mentioned on the [Import your Site Configuration into Cloud](#import-your-site-configuration-into-cloud) section in this guide.

### Dealing with Machine Creation Services (MCS) Machine Catalogs, Delivery and Application Groups and Policies

Currently, this tool does not support importing MCS machine catalogs or their corresponding delivery groups in an automated way. However, you can still import other configuration such as Applications and policies automatically using this tool.

You will need to ensure you create the **machine catalog** and **delivery group** using the same name as the On-Premises setup one. Please follow the steps below in order to prepare your environment, before proceeding to import the **Application** settings:

1.  In your [Cloud portal](https://citrix.cloud.com), click on the Hamburger menu > **My Services > Virtual Apps and Desktops Service > Manage** tab, in order to create your **MCS machine Catalog** as you normally would (by selecting the desired OS Type, Master Image, Storage, Licensing, Network and Account settings).**Important** Be sure to name your catalog **exactly** the **same way** your existing On-Premises catalog is named.
**Note:** If needed, please refer to [this guide](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/tech-zone/learn/poc-guides/cvads.html) for infomrmation on how to set up your catalogs.

2.  Still in **Cloud Studio**, create the corresponding **Delivery Group** for the new Catalog and ensure you name it exactly after the corresponding **On-Premises Delivery Group** as well. **Note:** For additional details on how to create your **Machine Catalogs** and **Delivery Groups**, please refer to [this guide](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/tech-zone/learn/poc-guides/cvads.html).

3.  In your On-Premises environment’s **Citrix Studio**, under the **Applications** node, confirm that the desired applications belong to the matching **Delivery Groups** by selecting the desired app and then right clicking on the app to go to the **Properties** as follows:
[![Provisioning Method MCS](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_other-prov-mcs-process-001.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_other-prov-mcs-process-001.png)

4.  Click on the **Groups** node to confirm the groups the app in question belongs to:

## Import your Site Configuration into Cloud

During this step, you will obtain the **customer connection details**, manually create your **Zone mappings** and **import the configuration** to your Cloud tenant.
**Note:** For **PVS** and **MCS**, first follow the corresponding subsections under the [Import your Site Configuration into Cloud section](#import-your-site-configuration-into-cloud) in this guide.

### Obtaining Customer Connection Details

Administrators must edit the ```CustomerInfo.yml``` file and add the corresponding **CustomerName**, **CustomerID** and **SecretKey** values to it. These values can be obtained and generated from the **Cloud portal**, as shown below.

1.  First, open your ```CustomerInfo.yml``` file using a text editor application, such as **Notepad**. The following screenshot shows the ```CustomerInfo.yml``` file values that will need to be edited (underlined in red):
[![Importing Configuration](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_importing-connection-details-001.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_other-importing-connection-details-001.png)

2.  On your [Cloud portal](https://citrix.cloud.com) click on the **hamburger Menu** again and go to **Identity and Access Management**:
[![Importing Configuration](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_importing-connection-details-002.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_other-importing-connection-details-002.png)

3.  Click on the **API Access** tab and copy the **Customer ID** value, which can be found next to the ```customer ID``` text as seen on the screenshot below (red rectangle):
[![Importing Configuration](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_importing-connection-details-003.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_other-importing-connection-details-003.png)

4.  Paste the retrieved value **between the quotes** that follow the **CustomerId field** in your ```CustomerInfo.yml``` file, right between the ```“”``` (quotes):
[![Importing Configuration](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_importing-connection-details-004.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_other-importing-connection-details-004.png)

5.  Back on your **Cloud portal**, under the **Identity and Access Management** portal and **API Access** tab, enter the name you wish to identify this API key with on the **Name your Secure Client** box and then click on the **Create Client** button. **Note:** This will generate the ```Client ID``` and the ```Secret Key```.
[![Importing Configuration](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_importing-connection-details-005.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_other-importing-connection-details-005.png)

6.  Copy the ```ID``` and the ```Secret``` values, one by one (paste them on the ```CustomerInfo.yml``` file as shown in the step below) and click on **Download** to save the file for later reference.
[![Importing Configuration](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_importing-connection-details-006.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_other-importing-connection-details-006.png)

7.  Paste the ```ID``` and ```Secret``` values onto the corresponding fields in the ```CustomerInfo.yml``` file:
[![Importing Configuration](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_importing-connection-details-007.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_other-importing-connection-details-007.png)

### Manually create the Zone Mapping file (ZoneMapping.yml)

**On-Premises Zones** cannot be automatically migrated to a **cloud Resource Location**, so they must be mapped using the ```ZoneMapping.yml``` file. **Note:** Migration failures will occur if the zone is not mapped with a homonymous resource location (a Resource Location with the exact same name).

1.  Back in the same directory where your *.yml* files reside ```(Documents\Citrix\AutoConfig)```, open up the ```ZoneMapping.yml``` using **Notepad** or your preferred text editor. **Note:** The ```Primary``` value must be replaced with the name of your corresponding Zone you wish to migrate objects from in your On-Premises environment.
[![Zone Mapping](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-001.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-001.png)

2.  You will find this name under your **On-Premises Citrix Studio console > Configuration > Zones**. **Note:** if your Zone is named ```Primary``` in your On-Premises environment, this value on the ```ZoneMapping.yml``` file doesn’t need to be changed:
[![Zone Mapping](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-002.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-002.png)

3.  Still on the ```ZoneMapping.yml``` file, the ```Name_Of_Your_Resource_Zone``` value should be replaced with your **Cloud Resource Location name**, which can be found on your [cloud portal](https://citrix.cloud.com) under the Hamburger Menu > **Resource Locations**:
[![Zone Mapping](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-003.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-003.png)

4.  Copy your **Resource Location name** (Shown as ```My Resource Location``` on the screenshot below):
[![Zone Mapping](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-004.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-004.png)

5.  Paste this value on the ```ZoneMapping.yml``` file in lieu of the ```Name_Of_Your_Resouce_Zone``` value:
[![Zone Mapping](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-005.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-005.png)

*  **Note:** Multiple Zones in your On-Premises environment can also map to **one Resource Location** in the cloud, but there always needs to be one row in the file for **each zone** in the **On-Premises environment**. For **multiple zones on-premises** and **one Resource Location**, the format on this file would look as follows:

[![Zone Mapping](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-006.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-006.png)

When mapping **Zones** to different **Resource locations**, the file must look like this instead:

[![Zone Mapping](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-007.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_zone-mapping-007.png)

### Merging configuration

1.  Back on the **Migration tool PowerShell console**, run the following command: ```Merge-CvadAcToSite```  in order to merge the existing Cloud configuration (should there be any) with the configuration exported from the On-Premises site.

2.  As tasks execute successfully, the output will look green as *.yml* files are imported and the corresponding components are added to the cloud site:

3.  The resulting files will show in the following directory: ```<This PC>\Documents\Citrix\AutoConfig\Import_<YYYY_MM_DD_HH_mm_ss>```
[![Merging Configuration](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_merging-config-003.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_merging-config-003.png)

4.  On this same folder, you will find a ```Backup_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_mm_ss``` folder. **Note:** Copy this folder somewhere safe as it is a backup of the configuration.

5.  The ```Backup``` folder contains the following files, which are helpful for reverting back, if needed:

### Verify configuration created in Cloud Studio

1.  Access your Virtual Apps and Desktops service **Manage** tab via the [Cloud Console](https://citrix.cloud.com) > **My Services > Virtual Apps and Desktops service > Manage tab**).
[![Verifying Configuration](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_verifying-config-001.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_citrix-automated-configuration_verifying-config-001.png)

2.  Refresh to make sure the **Machine catalogs**, **Delivery groups**, **policies**, **tags** and **applications** are now showing as expected. **Note:** This is dependent on what you import, so the results will vary depending on your own unique configuration. Review **each section** to make sure the expected items are listed.

*  **Machine Catalogs list example:**

If everything looks as expected, your CVADs migration is complete.

## Troubleshooting Tips

**General information for troubleshooting:**

*  Executing any cmdlet results in a created **log file** and an entry in the **master history log file**.
*  All operation log files are placed in a **backup folder**.
*  All log file names begin with ```CitrixLog```, then show the ```auto-config``` operation and the date and timestamp of the cmdlet execution.
*  Logs **do not** auto-delete.
*  The master history log is located in ```%HOMEPATH%\Documents\Citrix\AutoConfig```, in the file named ```History.Log```.
*  Each cmdlet execution results in a master log entry containing the date, operation, result, backup, and log file locations of the execution. This log provides potential solutions and fixes to common errors.
